# Crow's Nest

Get off me! Get off me you damn bird! I was so close to getting into space!
Now I'm sharing this cloudy sky with damn birds. Ah crap! I hate you, birds, squirrels, and what's that, a lumberjack? That's it, savage, kill us all, you don't care, you and your stupid shirt! What is this, Canada?

Roger Prankston, of Dorchester, is looking forward to prank his fellow fisherman Barney Victim. Oh oh. The prank was cheaper than he'd thought.

text = Oh, thy cloud spirit, pick me up, to the sky and beyond !
Sometimes, when humidity is too high, the Cloud Spirit manifests, just to put a found coin in the juke box and listen to her favorite song. And cry.
