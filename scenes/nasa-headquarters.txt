# NASA Headquarters
The new, brightly colored NASA headquarter is shining under the moonlight. Oh, these stars. If only I could shine brighter. I can get there. I know I can. I'm so close. Things are happening. The astronaut is entering the building. With all my fiscal might, I shall lure him over. Quick. And no mistake.
