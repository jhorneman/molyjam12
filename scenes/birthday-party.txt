# Birthday Party

What now? A goddamn birthday cake, noise, toddlers and crazy football moms. I hate kids. I hate people. Hopefully, nobody can see me... Harpo the magician is an amazing entertainer! I've been in his hand all along! What is he going to do ? The ol' coin in ear trick, improve his routine or get even more drunk?
