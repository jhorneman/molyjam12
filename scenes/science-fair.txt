# Science Fair

I can't believe Mathilde is using me for this stupid science fair. What kind of 
experiment is this anyway? A cold bottle, some cold water... I'm freezing! I'm shaking! Look at this place, there are so many places where I could be warmer. Inside this tampon machine, in the cosy library, or even dowstairs, in the sewer, where the rats roam free.

=== SCENE OPTIONS ===
[party-shop]
text = I think it's this time of the month again. Go for it, girl !
As usual, the janitor's been nicking some of the coins from the tampon and condom machines at school. He spends the
money on ridiculous party favors and pranks.

[launch-party]
text = You forgot to return your books on time ! Go pay the fee !
Roger, the school librarian's husband, was invited to attend the launch party of a hot new energy drink for pre-schoolers. He's taking his wife with him.

[morgue]
text = Hungry giant alligators roam the sewers. Super cool, girl ! Let's have a look.
Darla believes in giving the deceased enough
change to pay Charon, the Styx ferryman. This coin was made in her husband's birth year. Aww.
