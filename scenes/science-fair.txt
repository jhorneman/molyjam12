# Science Fair

I can't believe Mathilde is using me for this stupid science fair. What kind of 
experiment is this anyway? A cold bottle, some cold water... I'm freezing! I'm shaking! Look at this place, there are so many places where I could be warmer. Inside this tampon machine, in the cosy library, or even dowstairs, in the sewer, where the rats roam free.
