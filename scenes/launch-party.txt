# Launch Party

Awesome! A party with so many important people attending! Maybe one of them knows how to get into space! Hey, anyone! Look at me, I'm shiny! Pick me up! You there, with the racing leather jacket, pick me up! You, balloon pilot, pick me up! Or you with the... errr... giant cheese wheel?

=== SCENE OPTIONS ===
[crows-nest]
text = Up goes the balloon! Hitch a ride and get closer to the sky. So close, you can almost touch it.
Attracted by the sparkling coin, the crow approaches the balloon and grabs the coin
out of a tourist's hand. It flies of in the distance, a rich bird, indeed.

[nasa-headquarters]
text = Go, Speedracer, go !
The astronaut, having attended the launch party, is stoked to get a ride in a real racecar. Just as they're in the middle of nowhere, the engine dies. As luck has it, the reception is dead as well, but there's a payphone, with which he can call a cab and head back to NASA headquarters.

[birthday-party]
text = Roll the nut cheese wheel down the hill! Stupid game !
After rolling for hours, the cheese is melted enough under the sun to participate in a great fondue ! And what better place than a birthday party for this ?
