# Party Shop

Seriously? I'm at a store that sells party favors, cheap magic tricks and costumes? This is not going well. I'm far from my goal. I'm far from fame, grace, and amazing glory. Outside, a church bell is crushing the silence, a whore looks at us lustily and this crazy fortune teller keeps repeating the same thing:" There's no future, 'til you make it happen." Thanks for the tip, douchebag.

=== SCENE OPTIONS ===
[crows-nest]
text = There's no future, 'til you make it happen.
Perched atop the fortune telling machine, an old crow looks at the coin vividly. If it's sparkly, the crow will make sure to steal it and bring it to its nest. Oh look! That's exactly what happens!

[science-fair]
text = Let's cross the road and buy some candles, I need all the luck I can get.
The local priest pays the science fair a courtesy visit. Thank you Lord ! While purchasing a soda, the God's shepherd drops a few hard earned charity coins to the floor.

[morgue]
text = Hello my lady, care for a little company ?
During the day, dear Felicity works at the morgue. During her break she grabs a coffee from the coffee machine and forgets her change in the slot. Oh, Felicity!
