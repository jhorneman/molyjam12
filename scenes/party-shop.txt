# Party Shop

Seriously? I'm at a store that sells party favors, cheap magic tricks and costumes? This is not going well. I'm far from my goal. I'm far from fame, grace, and amazing glory. Outside, a church bell is crushing the silence, a whore looks at us lustily and this crazy fortune teller keeps repeating the same thing:"There's not future, 'til you make it happen." Thanks for the tip, douchebag.
