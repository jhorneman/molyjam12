This document describes the format of the CYOA scene text files.

Scene files should be normal plain text files with a .txt extension.
The filename should consist of just characters (a-z), number (0-9) and hyphens (-). The filename (without the extension) is the scene's identifier. It's used internally but not seen by the player.

Scene files start with:

# Scene title

(The hash makes this an h1 header in HTML. The transition text from the previous scene is inserted between the header and the rest of the text.)

Then you just write the scene text using plain text / markdown. The most important markdown syntax:

*italics*
**bold**

See http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics for more.

After the description you write:

=== SCENE OPTIONS ===

After this, new rules. List options using this format:

[next scene name]
parameter = value
parameter = value
free form transition text

So for example:

[start_andy]
text = Start Andy's storyline
min_sparkle = 5
delta_sparkle = 10
I entered Andy's storyline. Lots of weird colors!

Would generate a link to the scene "start_andy" (which is described  in start_andy.txt). The link text would be "Start Andy's storyline". The player would need at least 5 sparkle to be able to see the option, and will receive 10 sparkle for choosing it.
Anything that's not a line like "parameter = value" will be used as transition text on the next page. So you can't use '=' in transition texts...
Oh and transition texts can use markdown as well.
